Hyperbahn
=========

Hyperbahn is a service discovery and routing network that allows simple, reliable
communication with any service without any knowledge of where that service runs.

Hyperbahn supports the TChannel RPC protocol and works with Ringpop's gossip protocol
and consistent hash ring topology.

Hyperbahn and TChannel clients are currently supported in Go, Python, and Node.js.
